Processing DNA in a file
The file input.txt contains a number of DNA sequences, one per line. Each sequence
starts with the same 14 base pair fragment â€“ a sequencing adapter that should have
been removed. Write a program that will:
(a) trim this adapter and write the cleaned sequences to a new file and 


input = open("input.txt")
output = open("DNAcut.txt", "w")
for lines in input:
   DNAcut = lines[14:]
   output.write(DNAcut)



(b) print the length of each sequence to the screen.

input = open("input.txt")
output = open("DNAcut.txt", "w")
for lines in input:
   DNAcut = lines[14:]
   output.write(DNAcut)
   print("The sequence length is " + str(len(DNAcut)))



Multiple exons from genomic DNA
The file genomic_dna.txt contains a section of genomic DNA, and the file exons.txt
contains a list of start/stop positions of exons. Each exon is on a separate line and
the start and stop positions are separated by a comma. Write a program that will
extract the exon segments, concatenate them, and write them to a new file.

gDNA = open("genomic_dna.txt", "r").read()
exon = open("exons.txt", "r")
coding = ""
for lines in exon:
    sexon = lines.split(",")
    start = int(sexon[0])
    stop = int(sexon[1])
    DNAexon = gDNA[start:stop]
    coding = coding + DNAexon
    print("The coding sequence is: " + coding)
gDNA_coding = open("gDNA_coding.txt", "w")
gDNA_coding.write(coding)
gDNA_coding.close()
