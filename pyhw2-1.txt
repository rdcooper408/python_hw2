Processing DNA in a file
The file input.txt contains a number of DNA sequences, one per line. Each sequence
starts with the same 14 base pair fragment â€“ a sequenc
ing adapter that should have
been removed. Write a program that will:
(a) trim this adapter and write the cleaned sequences to a new file and 


input = open("input.txt")
output = open("DNAcut.txt", "w")
for lines in input:
   DNAcut = lines[14:]
   output.write(DNAcut)



(b) print the length of each sequence to the screen.

input = open("input.txt")
output = open("DNAcut.txt", "w")
for lines in input:
   DNAcut = lines[14:]
   output.write(DNAcut)
   print("The sequence length is " + str(len(DNAcut)))
