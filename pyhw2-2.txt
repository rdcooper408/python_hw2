Multiple exons from genomic DNA
The file genomic_dna.txt contains a section of genomic DNA, and the file exons.txt
contains a list of start/stop positions of exons. Each exon is on a separate line and
the start and stop positions are separated by a comma. Write a program that will
extract the exon segments, concatenate them, and write them to a new file.

gDNA = open("genomic_dna.txt", "r").read()
exon = open("exons.txt", "r")
coding = ""
for lines in exon:
    sexon = lines.split(",")
    start = int(sexon[0])
    stop = int(sexon[1])
    DNAexon = gDNA[start:stop]
    coding = coding + DNAexon
    print("The coding sequence is: " + coding)
gDNA_coding = open("gDNA_coding.txt", "w")
gDNA_coding.write(coding)
gDNA_coding.close()
